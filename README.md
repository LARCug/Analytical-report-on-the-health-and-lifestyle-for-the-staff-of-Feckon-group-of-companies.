They should also educate on staff on certain health aids such as avoiding doing stimulation activities such as exercise or watching existing movies before sleep as disrupts adequate sleep for them all.

-They should prioritise encouraging staff to take workday breaks to go and stretch themselves out,relax and recharge especially for the most stressful occupation.

-They should also prioritise managing workload on all employees. Employ more hands for the most stressful occupation and evenly distribute tasks among them to reduce workload on each staff.

-Wellness programs should be encouraged to promote physical activity and stress management. They could could add health incentives for staff and gender with high heart rates. this would in-turn help them go for regular health check ups.
